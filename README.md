# virus
This is a place for me to upload viruses.
I can use these with the (for example) curl command to download it to a computer quickly or i can use powershell to install andd run them quickly with or without a rubber ducky.
Or just to store viruses in general instead of on my computer which is probably a better idea.

Most of the viruses will be ones I made myself and if I add ones I didnt make they will go in a seperate folder within this repository.
Although they are probably already on github so there will be no need.


Note to me: Add another README that conatins a commands and a guide on how to download and open these viruses and other ones on github from one command.
